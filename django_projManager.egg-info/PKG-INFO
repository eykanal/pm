        ===========
        
        ProjManager is a project management application for management of projects for small groups. It allows users to define groups and users, as well as projects and tasks. The dashboard view allows for a quick birds-eye view of all current projects, while detail pages for both projects and people show more specifics about each project and person, respectively.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add ``pm`` and ``crispy_forms`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'pm',
                'crispy_forms',
            )
        
        2. Add the context processor to your app in two steps. First, import the current ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` setting from ``global_settings`` by adding the import statement at the top of ``settings.py``::
        
            from django.conf import global_settings
        
           Underneath the ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` variable declaration, add the following::
        
            TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS + (
                'pm.views.menu_items',
            )
        
        3. Set the required ``crispy_forms`` setting as follows (place at the bottom of ``settings.py``::
        
             CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap3'
        
        4. Include the pm URLconf in your project's ``urls.py`` like this::
        
        	url(r'^pm/', include('pm.urls', namespace='pm')),
        
        5. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the models.
        
        6. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to create users, groups, and projects (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        7. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/pm/ to view the projects application.
